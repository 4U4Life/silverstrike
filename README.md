There is a [demo](https://silverstrike.herokuapp.com/) available.
It is hosted on heruko and is auto deployed from the master branch. Since it is using the free tier, after 30 minutes of inactivity, the first page takes some time to load.

If you want your very own Production setup, you can create a very own instance for free using this button [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/simhnna/silverstrike/tree/heroku)
